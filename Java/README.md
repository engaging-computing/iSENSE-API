# Java Isense API

This API is created to work seamlessly with Android devices,
with the intention being to be packaged with the AppVis extension
for iSense. 
The version that ships with Android has some slight modifications
in order to get it to function on the platform, this version
uses more generic http components in order to make it compatible
with any Java Applications that wish to use the API.

## Build instructions

The easiest way to build the API is to import the directory into
Eclipse. In the (default) package will be Test.java. 
To make the Jar, simply export it as JAr into your Eclipse workspace.
